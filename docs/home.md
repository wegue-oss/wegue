# About

Wegue (**We**b**G**IS with OpenLayers and V**ue**) combines the power of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) to make lightweight webmapping applications. For styling and pre-defined UI-components the Material Design Component Framework [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) is used. It acts as a template to reduce boilerplate work for browser-based mapping applications.
